# Spotify-Churn-Analytics
An end-to-end data analysis and Random Forest modeling project designed to predict Spotify customer churn and transform insights into actionable retention strategies.

## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is one of the most critical business challenges for subscription-based platforms.

In this project, we analyze user behavioral data to:

* Identify patterns behind customer churn
* Build a predictive model to classify churn risk
* Deploy an interactive dashboard for real-time predictions
* Translate insights into actionable business value
